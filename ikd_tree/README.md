# ikd-Tree

This package is a simple repackaging of [ikd-Tree](https://github.com/hku-mars/ikd-Tree) for ROS1, written by HKU MARS. Description taken from the repository: "**ikd-Tree** is an incremental k-d tree designed for robotic applications. The ikd-Tree incrementally updates a k-d tree with new coming points only, leading to much lower computation time than existing static k-d trees. Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications."
